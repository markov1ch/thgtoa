Here is a brief How-To if you want to check the files for safety/integrity and authenticity.

The PDF files in this guide are also cryptographically signed using GPG and their integrity can be verified with the published SHA256 Chrecksum Hashes on this website.

SHA256 Checksums of all the PDFs are available here in the [sha256sum.txt](sha256sum.txt) file.

SHA256 Checksums, signatures, and virustotal checks of the releases files are available within release information at <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/releases/latest>

The GPG signatures for each PDF file are available here:
- (Light Theme) Main and Mirror: [guide.pdf.asc](guide.pdf.asc) 
- (Dark Theme) Main and Mirror: [guide-dark.pdf.asc](guide-dark.pdf.asc) 

Now to check the integrity of the files using the SHA256 Checksums please do the following:

Windows:
- From a command prompt, run ```certutil -hashfile filename.txt sha256```
- Compare the result with the hash in the online checksum files. They should match.

MacOS:
- From a terminal, run ```shasum -a 256 /full/path/to/your/file```
- Compare the result with the hash in the online checksum files. They should match.

Linux: 
- From a terminal, run ```sha256sum /full/path/to/your/file```
- Compare the result with the hash in the online checksum files. They should match.

All commits and releases on this repository are cryptographically signed and verified using the same GPG key. Check for the "Verified" tags on each commit or release.

Now to verify the files with GPG signatures, you should first install gpg on your system:
- Windows: Install gpg4win from <https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html>
- MacOS: Install GPG Tools from <https://gpgtools.org/>
- Linux: gpg should be installed by default

Import the GPG key using the following command from a command prompt or terminal:

```gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys 0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601```

In theory this command should fetch the key from the a default pool server. If this doesn't work, you can also download/view it directly from here: <https://anonymousplanet.org/AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc> <sup>[[Mirror]][12]</sup> <sup>[[Tor Mirror]][14]</sup>

For redundancy, you can also verify the authenticity of this GPG signature using:
- My Keybase.io profile <https://keybase.io/anonymousplanet>
- My Keyoxide.org profile <https://keyoxide.org/eb16b6ab4ab7ba61f33e2dfd0051e9a589dab601>

As well as the published key on (search for the fingerprint ```0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601```):
- <https://pgp.mit.edu>
- <https://keys.openpgp.org>
- <https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> 

You should then import it manually by issuing the following command on any OS:

```gpg --import AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc```

Finally, verify the asc signature file (links above) against the PDF files by issuing the following commands: 

```gpg --verify guide.pdf.asc guide.pdf"```
```gpg --verify guide-dark.pdf.asc guide-dark.pdf"```

This should output a result showing it matches and it's ok.

The PDF files in this guide have been checked by VirusTotal and Hybrid-Analysis, see the links below (**Note that this guide does not endorse VirusTotal/Hybrid-Analysis. Those should be used with extreme caution and never with any sensitive files due to their privacy policies.**)

For additional safety; you can always double check them using PDFID which you can download at <https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/> (You might be wondering why should trust a random python script? Well it's open-source and well-known. It's probably a safer bet than trusting a random PDF).

Here are the steps:

- Install latest 3.9.x version of Python on your OS, Download PDFID and, from a command prompt or terminal, run:

```python pdfid.py file-to-check.pdf```

And you should see the following entries at 0 for safety, this 0 means there is no Javascript or any action that could possibly embed malicious scripts. Normally this won't be neceessary as most modern PDF readers won't execute those scripts anyway.

```
/JS                    0 #This indicates the presence of Javascript which could be malicious
/JavaScript            0 #This indicates the presence of Javascript which could be malicious
/AA                    0 #This indicates the presence of automatic action on opening
/OpenAction            0 #This indicates the presence of automatic action on opening
/AcroForm              0 #This indicates the presence of AcroForm which could contain malicious JavaScript
/JBIG2Decode           0 #This indicates the PDF uses JBIG2 compression which could be used for obfuscating malicious content
/RichMedia             0 #This indicates the presence rich media within the PDF such as Flash
/Launch                0 #This counts the launch actions
/EmbeddedFile          0 #This indicates there are embedded files within the PDF
/XFA                   0 #This indicates the presence of XML Forms within the PDF
```
